☀️ Solar Power Prediction Application

A Full-Stack Machine Learning Case Study

📌 Overview

Accurately predicting solar power generation is critical for efficient energy management. Solar panel output is influenced by multiple dynamic factors such as ambient temperature, module temperature, and solar irradiation. Without accurate forecasting, energy grids and users face challenges with storage, distribution, and stability.

This project delivers a full-stack web application that predicts solar power output using a machine learning model, wrapped in a user-friendly frontend interface.

🎯 The Challenge

Solar energy production is non-linear and highly variable.

Grids need reliable forecasts for balancing supply & demand.

Manual estimation or traditional models are insufficient for accurate prediction.

✅ The Solution

I designed an end-to-end system combining:

Machine Learning → Predicts solar power output (kW).

Flask Backend API → Hosts the model & processes requests.

Interactive Frontend → Simple UI for users to input conditions and get real-time predictions.

This project showcases skills in data preprocessing, model training, optimization, deployment, and full-stack integration.

⚙️ Technical Architecture

🖥️ Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Jinja)

HTML5 → User input form & result display.

CSS3 → Modern, responsive styling.

JavaScript (ES6) → Asynchronous requests (fetch API), dynamic DOM updates.

🐍 Backend: Python & Flask

Flask API → /predict endpoint to serve ML model predictions.

Model Loading → Pre-trained model (Best_model_power_prediction.joblib) loaded at startup for efficiency.

Data Handling → JSON input → Model inference → JSON response.

🤖 Machine Learning Model

Features:

Ambient Temperature

Module Temperature

Irradiation

Irradiation (Lag-1)

Hour, Day of Week, Month

Pipeline: Feature engineering → Training → Hyperparameter tuning → Export with Joblib.

Model: Optimized regression model achieving high predictive accuracy on unseen test data.

🚀 Application Workflow

User enters environmental parameters in the frontend form.

Data sent via fetch() to the Flask /predict API.

Backend processes input & runs inference using the trained ML model.

Prediction returned as JSON.

Frontend updates the UI to display the predicted solar power output (kW).
